## Objectives

  * To get comfortable creating rails applications `rails new bacon_app`
  * Transfer Sinatra knowledge to Rails knowledge
  * Learn some Rails Conventions & Generators eg  `rails g model Cat name:string`
  * Have fun 
  * Come on Monday with tons of questions, things you tried and things you can't wait to try

## Requirements
  * At least 2 Models with their corresponding controllers, routes, and views eg dog
    * models/dog.rb
    * controllers/dogs_controller.rb # Use Appropriate actions i.e index, create 
    * views/dogs/index.html.erb 
    * routes.rb # this is created for you but fill out the appropriate routes 
      *NOTE*  Do not use `:resources`. Practice writing out RestFul Routing i.e `get "/dogs", to: "dogs#index"`
  * Make at *least* one of your controllers full CRUD (Create Read Update Destroy). This means that it should do all of the CRUD actions. 

## Expectations

We will be presenting your code on Monday morning to show what we've built. That being said don't pressure yourself on how it looks. We are looking for understanding of the following:
  * Routing
  * Request Response Cycle 
  * MVC and how they communicate


Don't worry this won't happen

# Resources 
 Your research this weekend should include but is not limited to the following: 
 
  * [Rails Tutorial Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)**
  * [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)

** This is free online and is one of the resources I used when I first learned. You only really need the first few chapters

# Bonus

* Make your models related [ActiveAssociations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) -> Doesn't have to be amazing but give yourself some chance to research it 
* Research writing [tests](http://rspec.info/)







#### Don't forget anything you build this weekend is going to be great!
